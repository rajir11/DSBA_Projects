CAPSTONE PROJECT
Analysis of Customer Churn in Telecommunication industry and retention strategies
Domain 
Rising customer attrition levels and ineffective retention strategy are of major concern in a telecom provider organization which impacts their Average revenue per unit. The main aim of this project is to identify factors influencing customer churn rate, building models to predict customers who are most likely to churn and provide recommendations to reduce customer churn. 
Skills and Tools
Cluster Analysis, TABLEAU, Classification, Ensemble, Exploratory Data Analysis
Conclusion
Churn rate is very high in New York and churned customers tend to have overage usage, with blocked data calls and dropped voice calls twice that of retained customers. Based on cluster analysis, customers with high usage tend to reach customer care often when compared to customers with low and moderate usage. Revising plan rates, rewarding long term customers, easy on-boarding process, resolving customer issues promptly, etc., would facilitate the organization in reducing the churn rate.
